# Sales Engine

This is a solo student project from Turing School of Software & Design as part of the Module 3 backend engineering curriculum.  The purpose of this project was to take CSV file data from an ecommerce site and use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the data schema.

## Learning Goals
* Learn how to to build Single-Responsibility controllers to provide a well-designed and versioned API.
* Learn how to use controller tests to drive your design.
* Use Ruby and ActiveRecord to perform more complicated business intelligence.
* API will be compliant to the JSON API spec. [Documentation](https://jsonapi.org/)
